node_ios_image_resizer
========

This is a simple node command line script to rename and resize images when developing for iOS and the Retina screen. 

	* copies the images from a source folder to a destination/2x and renaming to the @2x convention
	* resizes the same images by 50% and copies to the filder destination/1x (no rename)
